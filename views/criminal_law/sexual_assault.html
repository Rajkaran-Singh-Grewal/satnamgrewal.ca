	<h3>Sexual Assault</h3>
	<p>Assault of a sexual nature that violates the sexual integrity of the complainant is called sexual assault. There are sexual offenses such as sexual interference and sexual exploition that deal with the offenses involving sexual acts performed with young people or children by an adult.</p>
	<p>Sexual assault can be defined as contact of a "sexual nature" applied intentionally and occuring without the consent of another person or a threat by act or gesture to apply force of a sexual nature to another person. A sexual assault is alleged to have occurred where the complainant submits or does not resist non-consensual sexual activity because of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant.</p>
	<p>Determining if the assault, alleged to have occured, was of a sexual nature is usually done by examing the alleged conduct and circumstances such as which part of the body was being touched, what part of the body the accused to touch, the nature of the contact, the situation in which it occured, the words and gestures accompanying the act and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct including the motives of the accused.</p>
