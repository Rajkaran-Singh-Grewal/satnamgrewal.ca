	<h3>Regulatory Offense</h3>
	<p>Regulatory offenses are quasi-criminal offenses such as careless driving, driving while suspended, unlawfully hunting and fishing, and health and safety violations. Regulatory Offenses are provisional, non-criminal offenses. They include offenses set out in legislation such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Highway Traffic Act</li>
		<li>The Liqour License Act</li>
		<li>The Occupational Health and Safety Act</li>
		<li>The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act</li>
		<li>The Fire Protection and Prevention Act</li>
		<li>The Environment Protection Act</li>
	</ul>
	<p> It is easier to be convicted of a Regulatory Offense than a criminal offense. Regulatory Offense convitions do not result in a criminal record, and many people do not take them seriously. The consequences of a Regulatory Offense conviction can be signigicant. The penalties can include large monetary fines, probation orders and even jail time.</p>
